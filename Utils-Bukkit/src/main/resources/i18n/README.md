Translations [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/elmedievo/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/elmedievo)
===

Every language [supported by the Minecraft client](https://crowdin.net/project/minecraft) is supported by our project.

All of the base strings live in [strings.properties](template/strings.properties), and may be edited
when making modifications to the project. Modifications to the English string templates may take some time in order
to show up at our [Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/elmedievo)

**Note**: Please do not modify any *translation* files directly in this repo. Instead, translations should be submitted
through [our Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/elmedievo), through the process described above.
